# Stalker Proxy

A lightweight Node.js proxy that handles Stalker/Ministra portal authentication and CORS so StreamVault can talk to IPTV portals from a browser.

## Why is this needed?

Stalker portals require:
1. A **token handshake** — the portal issues a session token tied to your MAC address
2. Specific **User-Agent and Cookie headers** that browsers won't send cross-origin
3. **CORS headers** that most portal servers don't include

This proxy handles all three transparently.

## Setup

```bash
cp .env.example .env
npm install
npm start
# Runs at http://localhost:3001
```
